useReduce() - It is a state management hook that is similar to useState(). The difference is useReduce() is used when the logic of useState() is complex and involves more sub values.

useReduce() has a reducer function which is not a part of functional component. 

const reducer=(state)=>{
   
    case '1':
       return new state
    case ' ':
      return new state
    default:
      return state
}

function Demo()
{
    const[reducer,dispatch]=useReduce(initialState)

    return(
        <div>
        </div>
    )
}
